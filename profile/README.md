## AI for Public Services

_**The AI for Public Services team seeks to improve public services and outcomes for citizens through the responsible and effective adoption of AI by governmentr**_

We conduct foundational research investigating the big picture of when and where AI can be applied in government and carry out technical projects with government on the adoption of AI in a specific public sector use case.  

Drawing on our academic expertise, we apply data science methods and reproducible analyses to understand how AI can improve the provision and delivery of public services. Informed by our research programme and sectoral experience, we collaborate with government partners to design and implement AI applications for a particular prediction, detection, or simulation problem. Our expertise is grounded in our knowledge of a range of AI and data science methods, and our understanding of which method is best for a particular government use case. 

We aim to support and work alongside government to plan, develop, and deploy data science and AI methods to improve public services. Our interdisciplinary team brings skills in artificial intelligence, data science, social science, regulation and governance, and experience working in organisations from NESTA, the CDEI, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport and the Oxford Internet Institute. The unique composition of our team can support with both technical development and integration alongside supporting responsible governance, deployment, and integration. 

We are currently undertaking research work into AI/ML applications for government, mapping decision-making, public sector use of satellite imagery, and exploring operational oversight requirements of systems in use.  Our current work explores uniquely questions of definition, integration, oversight, techniques through the lens of the unique needs of public services. 


### Projects

Our recent and forthcoming work within these themes includes: 

- **Mapping the use of AI in Government**: Paper presenting a conceptual typology of AI-based systems for government (AI-GOV) which introduces three new multifaceted dimensions: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17218 

- **Optimising human-machine collaboration in public sector deployment**: Paper accepted at the Human-Centred AI workshop at NeurIPS 2022 exploring the design of public-sector oversight within high-stakes public services. Current projects will explore team oversight within the public sector and the impact upon oversight and standards of professional bodies. https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/arq3w/ 

- **Participatory Governance of AI**: Draft chapter in development exploring the challenges of participatory governance of AI in public administration: https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pdcrm/ 

- **Satellite imagery and ML for public services**. Paper presented at the Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2022 which estimates Chicagoâ€™s tree cover and canopy height using multi-spectral satellite imagery.  

- **Employing AI to improve decisions made around homelessness case study**: prediction, resource allocation and fairness
