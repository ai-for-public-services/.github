## AI for Public Services

_**The AI for Public Services team seeks to improve public services and outcomes for citizens through the responsible and effective adoption of AI by governmentr**_

We conduct foundational research investigating the big picture of when and where AI can be applied in government and carry out technical projects with government on the adoption of AI in a specific public sector use case.  

We are currently undertaking research work into AI/ML applications for government, mapping decision-making, public sector use of satellite imagery, and exploring operational oversight requirements of systems in use.  Our current work explores uniquely questions of definition, integration, oversight, techniques through the lens of the unique needs of public services. 


### Projects

Our recent and forthcoming work within these themes includes: 

- **Mapping the use of AI in Government**: Paper presenting a conceptual typology of AI-based systems for government (AI-GOV) which introduces three new multifaceted dimensions: https://ai-for-public-services.github.io/ai-gov-framework/

- **Satellite imagery and ML for public services**. Paper presented at the Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2022 which estimates Chicagoâ€™s tree cover and canopy height using multi-spectral satellite imagery.  https://ai-for-public-services.github.io/img-rtc-demonstrator/

- **Optimising human-machine collaboration in public sector deployment**: Paper accepted at the Human-Centred AI workshop at NeurIPS 2022 exploring the design of public-sector oversight within high-stakes public services. Current projects will explore team oversight within the public sector and the impact upon oversight and standards of professional bodies. https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/arq3w/ 

- **Participatory Governance of AI**: Draft chapter in development exploring the challenges of participatory governance of AI in public administration: https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pdcrm/ 

- **Employing AI to improve decisions made around homelessness case study**: prediction, resource allocation and fairness
